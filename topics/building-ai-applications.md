# Topic: Building AI Applications

## Why I Want to Learn This
- Build practical AI-powered tools and agents for my organisation
- Champion AI adoption: help teams use AI for better software development, testing, monitoring, and troubleshooting
- Specifically relevant to trading systems: AI-powered log analysis, anomaly detection, intelligent runbooks, production support agents
- Understand the full stack from prompt engineering to production deployment

## Current Knowledge Level
beginner

## Goal
Be able to:
1. Build and deploy RAG systems over internal documentation and codebases
2. Create AI agents that can use tools, plan, and execute multi-step tasks
3. Fine-tune models for domain-specific tasks when appropriate
4. Integrate AI into software development workflows (code review, testing, CI/CD)
5. Build AI agents for production support and troubleshooting of trading systems
6. Evaluate and monitor AI systems in production
7. Advocate for and lead AI adoption within the organisation with concrete demos and patterns
