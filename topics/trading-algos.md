# Topic: Trading Algorithms & Strategies

## Why I Want to Learn This
Understand the math behind trading strategies — what each algorithm optimizes for, when to use it, its limitations, and how to implement it. This complements the C++ Trading Systems topic (engineering/systems side) with the quantitative/math side.

## Current Knowledge Level
Beginner. Have built a feed handler and understand market data/order books, but haven't implemented any trading strategies or studied the quantitative models behind them.

## Goal
Be able to read a strategy paper, understand the math, evaluate its tradeoffs, and reason about how to implement it in a trading system. For each strategy: know the formula, when to use it, pros/cons, and implementation notes. Understand key derivations, not just formulas.

## Resources
Curated mix of papers, blog posts, lecture notes, and open-source implementations (see learning plan for full list):
- Papers: Almgren & Chriss (2000), Avellaneda & Stoikov (2008), Guéant-Lehalle-Fernandez-Tapia, Engle & Granger, Moskowitz-Ooi-Pedersen (2012), Fama & French
- Lecture notes: Algorithmic trading courses (various universities)
- Blog posts: QuantStart, Quantitative Trading (Ernie Chan), blog posts on stat arb and market making
- Books: Ernest Chan "Algorithmic Trading", Narang "Inside the Black Box"
- Open-source: various strategy implementations on GitHub
