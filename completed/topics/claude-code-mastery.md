# Topic: Claude Code Mastery

## Why I Want to Learn This
Learn all the power-user tricks and workflows in Claude Code to become highly effective at AI-assisted software engineering. Claude Code is my primary development tool — the better I understand it, the more leverage I get on everything else.

## Current Knowledge Level
Active user — comfortable with basic prompting, file edits, and git workflows. Haven't explored hooks, MCP servers, custom subagents, headless mode, agent teams, or most of the advanced configuration.

## Goal
Be able to use Claude Code at a power-user level: know the keyboard shortcuts by muscle memory, have a well-tuned CLAUDE.md and settings setup, use hooks for automation, connect MCP servers for external tools, create custom subagents and skills, and understand when to use plan mode, extended thinking, and agent teams.

## Resources
- Claude Code official docs (docs.anthropic.com)
- Built-in commands: `/help`, `/config`, `/hooks`, `/mcp`, `/agents`, `/permissions`
- Hands-on experimentation in real projects

## Time Estimate
Ongoing — 2 hours/week, updated as features evolve
